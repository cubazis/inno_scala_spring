# Qualifying Scala project

## Interpreter implementation

For this project team should implement interpreter of a functional language, that looks like ML family of languages (Haskell, OCaml, F#). This project is split to steps from the simplest implementation to a more advanced. The goal is to go as far as possible. This project is curated by Alexandr Basov (tg: @basov_ae), feel free to ask questions, all steps could be discussed, if you have own ideas for language implementation, you are welcome.

## Motivation and results

By this project we can learn more about functional languages, by implementing one! This is a good start if you want to try language development from scratch. The result language would be not so useful to write real-life programs, but would be a good start for going further. We use [lambda-calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) here as a core language, than we improved it to a state where you can easily express some untyped lambda-calculus programs with recursion. From there, types, pattern-matching, literals for common data-structures could be added.

## Project roadmap

- Implement lambda-calculus interpreter
  - It should be REPL, that could be compiled and run. Read lambda-term from the console, evaluate it, output the result of evaluation
- Def declaration (C-grade)
  - Used to define functions that later could be used to evaluate terms
- Syntax improvement
  - Make syntax of the language to look like more human-readable
- Support of conditional construction (if-than-else) (B-grade)
- Support recursion via fixed-point combinator (A-grade)

# Explanations of each step

From here goes explanation of each step, some theory and approaches how it could be implemented.

## 1-step lambda calculus

This is tiny language that as powerful as turing machine. Terms could be defined as:
```
| Syntax   | Name        | Definition                                                                         |
|----------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| x        | Variable    | A character or string representing a value                                         |
| \x.t     | Abstraction | Function definition (t is a term). The variable x becomes bound in the expression. |
| (t u)    | Application | Applying a function to an argument. t and u are terms.                             |
```
And the rules for evaluation are:
```
| Syntax                | Name             | Definition                                              |
|-----------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| \x.t{x} -> \y.t{y}    | alpha-conversion | Rename bound occurrence of x to y                       |
| (\x.t u) -> t{x:=u}   | beta-reduction   | Apply left term to other by replacing bound x in t by u |
```
Variables could be free or bounded, this can be defined inductively as:

- The free variables of `x` are just `x`
- The set of free variables of `\x.t` is the set of free variables of `t`, but with `x` removed
- The set of free variables of `(t u)` is the union of the set of free variables of `t` and the set of free variables of `u`
- Other variables are bounded variables

Also to define how term should be evaluated, we introduce Beta-normal forma, that defined as:

- If we can apply beta-reduction to term `t`, `t` is called a redex
- If beta-reduction cannot be applyed, than `t` is in the Beta-normal form

This is small but yet powerful language. [This is a good introduction with examples of numbers definition, operations on numbers and recursion](https://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/lehre/WS03/alpi/lambda.pdf)

To implement the language, we can follow this steps:

- Write a type that defines grammar of lambda calculus
- Write a function that evaluates expression of lambda-calculus to Beta-normal form
- Write a parser that can take a string and produce lambda-calculus term
- Combine parser with evaluation with REPL

## 2-step def expressions (C grade)

After implementation of the first step, we can construct lambda terms, but it is not convinient to just write big terms, `def` adds some sort of abstraction. Now our program would be a set of declarations and a term to evaluate.

```
# this a functions that takes an argument and returns it
def id = \x.x
(id y)
# evaluated by converting (id y) to (\x.x y)
# than we do beta-reduction and receive y as a result
```

## 3-step syntax improvement

We can improve syntax of our language a bit, to be more simple. Consider `def id = \x.x` we say that id is a function of one argument that has a body. We can rewrite that function as `id x = x`, or consider function `def add = \x.\y.'some body that adds two numbers'`, than we can rewrite it as `def add x y = ...` where `...` is body that should be defined.

The next improvement is the `(t u)` expression, consider application `(((t u1) u2) u3)`, where `t` for example a function of three arguments: `\x.\y.\z.'some body here'`, brackets here are left-associative, we can improve syntax by saying that: `(..(t u1).. un) == t u1 ... un`.

We also can improve syntax of lambda-abstraction, consider `\x.t` firstly we replace `. to ->`, so our abstraction syntax now is `\x -> t`. Than we say, that if we have sequence of abstractions: `\x.\x1. ... \xn.'body'` or with new syntax: `\x -> \x1 -> ... \xn`, than we can rewrite such expression as: `\x x1 ... xn -> 'body'`.

## 4-step conditional construction (B-grade)

In our language we want to have some standard o
operators such as if than else. We can define true and false in lambda calculus as (here new syntax from 2 step is used):

```
def true x y = x
def false x y = y
```

So `true` and `false` are functions of two arguments. That `true` returns first argument and `false` return the second. Now we can define a function that behaves like `if-than-else`:

```
def ifThanElse bool thanBranch elseBranch = ((bool thanBranch) elseBranch)
# or rewritten as according to improved syntax
def ifThanElse bool thanBranch elseBranch = bool thanBranch elseBranch
```

So the logic is pretty straightforward, we supply `true` or `false` with two arguments, `true` will return the first one, `false` the second one. This logic could be seen in tuples too:

```
def fst x y = x
def snd x y = y
def getFromTuple getter x y = getter x y
```

Now we can add this `ifThanElse` logic as embedded construction in the language:

```
def true x y = x
def false x y = y

def smth = 'function that computes something'
def smthElse = 'function that computes something else'

def example x = if x than smth else smthElse

example true
```

Or for example we can define `not` function as:

```
# bool is either true of false functions
def not bool = if bool than false else true
```

We also can add this syntax for `if than else`:

```
def not bool =
  if bool
  than false
  else true
```

### 5-step recursion (A-grade)

To compute something interesting we often want loops, in functional world we do loops with recursion. But here comes the problem, recursion uses name of a function in recursive part, but lambda calculus does not have names for function, we introduced `def` bindings that acts by substitution original code, it is not actuale 'name'. We can solve this problem by using [Y-combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator#Fixed_point_combinators_in_lambda_calculus) or more generally fixed point combinator.

This paragraph should explain how it is possible to define recursion. Consider numbers in the [Church encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding):

```
def 0 f x = x # looks like false function
def 1 f x = f x # we apply f to x 1 time
def 2 f x = f (f x) # f applied 2 times
...
# defs define succ that will do +1
# this probably takes some time to understand
def plus m n f = m f (n f x)
def succ n f x = f (n f x) # or def succ = plus 1

# than defs define some operations
def mult m n f = m (n f)
def pred n f x = n (\g h -> h (g f)) (\u -> x) (\u -> u)

# because 0 actually is alpha-equivalent to false
def isZero num = if num than false else true
```

Firstly we try to solve problem in the straightforward way:

```
def fuc n =
  if isZero n
  than 1
  else mult n (fuc (pred n))
```

The problem here is that we do the replacement of `fuc` in the term (some sort of macros), so it will never terminate. But we can introduce additional argument for arbitrary function:

```
# <function> <argument>
# becomes
(\f -> (f argument)) function =>
function argument
```

We can abuse this to do:

```
def fuc1 f n =
  if isZero n
  than 1
  else mult n (f f (pred n)) # we should put two f here to work (try 1 f)

# Than
def fuc = fuc1 fuc1
# (fuc1 fuc1) =>
# \n ->
#   if isZero n
#   than 1
#   else mult n (fuc1 fuc1 (pred n))

# let's try evaluate
fuc 2 =>
mult 2 (if isZero 1 than 1 else mult 1 (fuc1 fuc1 (pred 1))) =>
mult 2 (mult 1 (if isZero 0 than 1 else mult 0 (fuc1 fuc1 (pred 0)))) =>
mult 2 (mult 1 1) => mult 2 1 => 2
```

The problem to solve it that line:

```
...
else mult n (f f (pred n)) # we should put two f here to work (try 1 f)
```

We want a function that takes non-recursive function of the form `\f arg -> if cond than terminateCondition else f (recursionStep)`
For `fuc` it would be:

```
def fuc1 f n =
  if isZero n
  than 1
  else mult n (f (pred n))
```

We can achieve the goal by introducing:

```
def fix f = (\x -> f (x x)) (\x -> f (x x))
# fix g => g (fix g) => g (g (fix g)) => ...

# lets now try
def fuc = fix fuc1 =>
def fuc = (\f -> (\x -> f (x x)) (\x -> f (x x))) fuc1 =>
def fuc = (\x -> fuc1 (x x)) (\x -> fuc1 (x x))
def fuc = fuc1 ((\x -> fuc1 (x x)) (\x -> fuc1 (x x))) =>
def fuc n =
  if isZero n
  than 1
  else mult n (fuc1 ((\x -> fuc1 (x x)) (\x -> fuc1 (x x))) (pred n))
```

Now using implemented `fix` we can introduce `rec` syntax:

```
def fuc1 f n =
  if isZero n
  than 1
  else mult n (f (pred n))

def fuc = fix fuc1

#Now become
rec fuc n =
  if isZero n
  than 1
  else mult n (fuc (pred n))
```
