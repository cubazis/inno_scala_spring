## Group project [2-3 weeks]
As Twitter using scala, we can start with some dummy twitter-clone. **It should be just API!** If you want to do some frontend, do it as separate project that calls your API.

### Entities
You can store everything in memory, since it could be a trouble to use persistent storage (but if you want and can use it) 

* User
    * User has: id, email, nickname, password
    * id and email should be unique
* Twit
    * Twit should have: id, text, author, submission time
    * id should be unique
    * [Optional] Twit has likes, dislikes, see `Functionality` section too

### Functionality
* A guest can register and then sign in (he is User from that moment), sign out
    * For sessions use [JWT-tokens](https://jwt.io/), since it is common to use     them now, cookies is option too, but JWT is better for reasons
* User can create twits and only edit and destroy his twits
    * [Optional] Implement mentioning of other people by his nickname
* User can subscribe to other users
* User can get his feed that consists of other users twits
* User can get other users feed (to decide if he want to subscribe to that user)
* User can re-tweet other users twits, so subscribers will get this twit (author should be mentioned) in their feeds
    * He also should be able to remove his re-twit
    * If author will remove his twit, all re-twits of that twit should not be visible too
* [Optional] User can like or dislike a twit
    * If he likes a twit and then dislike it, like is removed and dislike is added. This should works vice versa too
    * User can also just remove his like or dislike

### Criteria of done
* Code on [github](https://github.com/)
* Project could be built using instructions in your `README.md` in repository
* Make a small report that points out what was done (which functionality is working). Report must be no more than one page A4 (pdf).
    * If you haven't managed something to work please write why, so we can cover this material during the course. 
    * Use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to test your API and publish your collection, add link in your report
    * [Optional] If you used some additional tools/materials/guides, please mention them in the report, it could be helpful for other students and try to connect the problem you was solving and material that you was using.
